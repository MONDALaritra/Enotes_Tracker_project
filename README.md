# Enotes_Tracker_project
This is a web project that is for all common users, especially students and teachers. Every time we go anywhere, we always don't carry pen and paper with us. But in that case, if we have to memorize any sensitive or important data, then we have to store it. To solve that problem, this is the project where any user can add their notes freely and retrieve and also edit their notes whenever they want to do so. In this project, the Spring MVC framework is used. Various concepts like Model, View, and Controller are used here to design the backend operations of this project. I hope this project can help users.
