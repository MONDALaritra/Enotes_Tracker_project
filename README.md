# Enotes_Tracker_project
This is a web project which is for all common users, specially for students, teachers. Every time when we go anywhere we always don't carry pen and paper with us. But in that case if we have to memorize any sensitive or important data then we have to store it. To solve that problem this is the project where any user can add their notes freely, and retrieve and also edit their notes whenever they wants to do so.In this project Spring MVC framework is used. Various concepts like Model , View, Controller are used here to design the backend operations of this project. Hope this project can help users.
